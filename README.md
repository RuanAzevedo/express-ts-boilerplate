# Typescript + Express dev boilerplate

A boilerplate to quick start some API project.

This boilerplate comes with the following:

- `typescript`: for types
- `prettier`: to set a standard code style
- `eslint`: for feedback on code problems (static code analysis)
- `husky + lint-staged`: for pre-commit linting
- `ts-node-dev`: to restart the app at code changes

Also, it starts with scaffolding for the `express` server, routing, and a first auth middleware.

## Quick Start

Install the dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Start the app:

```
yarn dev
```

#### With `npm`
